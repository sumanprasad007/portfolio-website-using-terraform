INTRODUCTION

The concept of Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) has become increasingly popular in the software development industry, as organizations strive to streamline their software delivery processes and reduce errors. CI/CD are practices that aim to automate the process of building, testing, and deploying software, enabling developers to deliver new features and bug fixes to production faster and with greater confidence. Implementing CI/CD pipelines has been made easier by the usage of cloud computing platforms like Amazon Web Services (AWS) [1,2,4].


AWS provides a range of services that can be used to automate the various stages of a CI/CD pipeline, from source code management to build and test, and finally deployment. This includes services such as GitHub, AWS CodeBuild, and AWS CodeDeploy, which can be combined to create a complete CI/CD pipeline. By utilising these services, businesses can speed up cooperation, decrease the likelihood of errors, and cut down on the time and effort needed to deploy software [2,4,5].


In this Report, we will examine the benefits of using AWS to create a complete CI/CD pipeline for an application, and explore the various AWS services that can be used to automate the different stages of the pipeline. We will provide insights and recommendations for organizations looking to adopt this approach, and present a case study demonstrating how a complete CI/CD pipeline can be created using AWS. In addition to the benefits outlined above, using AWS for a CI/CD pipeline also provides the added advantage of scalability. With AWS, organizations can easily scale their infrastructure to meet the demands of their software delivery process, without the need for significant upfront investments in hardware. This makes AWS an ideal choice for organizations of all sizes, from small startups to large enterprises [7,8,9].

## 1.1	EXISTING DEFENCE SYSTEMS AND SOLUTIONS
Before the adoption of CI/CD pipelines, software deployment was often a manual and time-consuming process that involved several stages. Here are some of the common steps involved in manual software deployment:

â€¢	Code development: Developers write code on their local machines, and then commit it to a shared code repository. They may use a version control system like Git to manage changes to the codebase.

â€¢	Build: Once the code is committed, it needs to be compiled and built into a deployable artifact. This involves running a series of commands to compile the code, resolve dependencies, and package it into a format suitable for deployment.

â€¢	Testing: After the build process is complete, the application needs to be tested to ensure that it functions correctly. This may involve manual testing by a quality assurance (QA) team or automated testing using tools like Selenium or JUnit.

â€¢	Deployment: Once the code is built and tested, it needs to be deployed to the production environment. This involves copying the artifacts to the server, configuring the server settings, and ensuring that the application is up and running.

â€¢	Monitoring: After deployment, the application needs to be monitored to ensure that it continues to function correctly. This may involve setting up alerts and notifications to notify the operations team of any issues that arise.

Manual software deployment can be a time-consuming and error-prone process. With CI/CD pipelines, these stages can be automated, resulting in faster, more reliable software delivery. 

## 1.2	HOW A NEW SOLUTION CAN IMPROVE CERTAIN ISSUES
Implementing an AWS CI/CD pipeline can help to address several issues with traditional manual software deployment processes. By automating the build, test, and deployment stages of software development, CI/CD pipelines can help to reduce errors, increase collaboration, and speed up the delivery of new features and bug fixes to production.
However, even with a CI/CD pipeline in place, there may still be some challenges that need to be addressed. Here are some examples of how a new solution could improve certain issues with the AWS CI/CD pipeline:

â€¢	Limited Integration with Existing Tools: One issue with using AWS for CI/CD is that it may not integrate well with existing tools and systems. For example, if an organization is using a different code repository than GitHub, it may be challenging to integrate that repository with AWS CodeBuild and CodeDeploy. A new solution could be developed to provide better integration between AWS services and existing tools. For example, a third-party integration tool could be developed that allows organizations to connect their preferred code repository with AWS CodeBuild and CodeDeploy.

â€¢	Difficulty in Scaling Up: Another challenge with the AWS CI/CD pipeline is that it may be difficult to scale up quickly to meet the needs of a growing organization. As demand for software delivery increases, organizations may need to add more resources to their pipeline to keep up with demand. A new solution could be developed to make it easier to scale up the AWS CI/CD pipeline. For example, a tool could be developed that allows organizations to easily add more computing resources to their pipeline as needed, without having to manually configure and manage those resources.

â€¢	Security Concerns: Security is always a concern when it comes to software development and deployment. While AWS provides a number of security features and best practices, there may still be vulnerabilities that need to be addressed. A new solution could be developed to provide additional layers of security for the AWS CI/CD pipeline. For example, a security tool could be developed that scans code for vulnerabilities before it is deployed to production, or a monitoring tool could be developed that alerts organizations to potential security breaches in real-time.

In summary, while the AWS CI/CD pipeline offers many benefits, there may still be issues that need to be addressed. A new solution could be developed to address these issues and provide additional benefits to organizations using the AWS CI/CD pipeline. â€ƒ
